## Overview

In this project I am analyzing and building visual representations using Tableau that will be presented to an investor meeting about opening a bike ridesharing business in the Des Moines area. The data will be used in a proof of concept meeting so it will need to be concise and easy to understand. As with all Tableau presentations the most important element is to ensure we are asking the right questions. For this project the question the first question that needs addressed is how many bike trips happened in August. Secondly we want to identify the types and proportions of customers. In this case we have short-term customers and annual subscribers. In order to estimate how many bikes would be ideal for the Des Moines area we need to examine the peak hours of use. Next, we will want to understand where the highest traffic locations are in order to build a strategy for setting up the infrastructure. 

The next level of analysis we need is to better understand our potential customer base. First, we examine the ratio of female-to-male users with the male users being the substantial majority. Age demographics are an important next level to understand by examining the average trip duration per age. Moving beyond potential income measures, it will be important to understand the cost drivers for the potential business. For this I examined both the number of uses and the duration of time in use. These figures give a representation for how much use the fleet will get and will allow them to strategize around performing maintenance on them. 

Once all of these data sheets are created I used Tableau to then create a dashboard for the information to be centrally located. Delving deeper into the analysis I built a graph to examine the distribution of trip durations. This graph was expanded on to showcase trip durations broken down by gender. Heat maps were created to display the days and times of use in order to better understand use patterns. Once again, this heat map was broken down to examine these trends by gender. A final map was created in order to see how daily use was distributed when looking at gender and the two user types of subscribers and customers. The visualizations were collated into a storyboard which is linked below:

## Results

1) The graph below illustrates the most common trip durations. The most common duration is 5 minutes and the usage time falls off sharply from there. This is an important indicator as to what the primary use of the bikes are expected to be. This data along with the "Top Starting Locations" map show that bike rentals are most common in congested, popular areas in the city in which public transportation, taxis, and other transportation alternatives present many challenges that will drive the demand for renting bikes. With average ride times being 5 minutes and with these areas having high density in particular areas it will be important for the company's viability to ensure that a steady amount of bikes will be available in these popular areas. Short rides and high volume are the keys aspects of users.

2) Although the ratio of male riders to female riders is a significant difference, they do exhibit very similar trip duration patterns. In this respect there would be no significant trend in usage that would yield any reason to market to either population in a particular manner. It is fair to say that bikes are not being used as some sort of exercise regiment or extensive exploration of the city. Uknown users are likely to be tourists to the area. They use the bikes for more extended durations as they are likely sight seeing and exploring rather than having a distinct location they are trying to get to in at a particular time like work commuters.

3) This map provides an incredible amount of insight into what types of users the company has attracted. Peak times during the week are during typical commuter hours for workers. This map coupled with the "Top Starting Locations" map shows that the bike sharing program is hugely driven by local residents in the city that utilize the bike sharing service as their main method of transportation to and from work. The evening hours are in greater demand as these commuters are also joined by those visiting these locations during peak dining hours. Weekend use is fairly evenly spread throughout the day as this is likely when these locals are traveling throughout the city during their off hours.

4) Men and women have similar use patterns throughout the weekdays and weekends. Again, the usage between men and women is drastically different. Considering that the majority of use revolves around commuters hours the reason women may be significantly lower than men may be something as simple as differences in work attire. Women are likely to wear skirts and heels to work, which is not practical bike riding attire. Additionally women are more likely to carry their personal items in purses as opposed to men that traditionally wear backpacks. An opportunity for the company would be to delve into why the difference exists and to discover whether there are ways they can market or curate their product in order to capture more female users. Unknown gender patterns support the theory that this population is tourists as they primarily use the services on the weekends.

5) In terms of marketing the company must understand that male subscribers are the bread and butter of their business. They have potential to tap into a large segment of business if they can find ways of making their bikes more functional for business women.

6) The visualizations below showcase two significant marketing questions of who is using bike sharing and where are they using them. These two key pieces of information must serve as the foundation for all marketing efforts. Firstly, the breakdown of users is over 2-to-1 ratio of men using bike sharing services compared to women. This is a signficant difference that should influence how the company targets its marketing efforts and would influence the types and styles of bikes they should purchase. Secondly, the Top Starting Locations map is ciritical for them to strategically set up their checkout locations. By targeting these areas they will likely capture greater profits by meeting the demand in these areas. Understanding what drives demand is also important for them to potentially gain further business. At first glance the areas appear to be in congested, popular areas in which other transportation methods would be inferior options. Bike sharing allows for quick, cheaper access to these popular locations that also provide them the flexibilty to use the service across multiple short trip durations to travel amongst the various landmarks in the city. Finding ways of appealing to business people in the area is essential for growing the business. 

## Summary

The visualizations and data analysis conducted in this project has given us a very clear understanding of the prospective business factors. The investors will ultimately need to assess whether Des Moines has the characteristics needed to support a bike sharing business. The business relies upon a population of local business professionals that will rely upon ride sharing for their work commute. Weather, housing and business district analysis, and public transportation options are all factors that will contribute greatly to the potential success of a ride share business. In addition to the visualizations captured above I would like to create a one that shows repair and maintenance costs for the bicycles and another graph that would correlate the maintenance expenses with usage and whether any correlations exist between the # of rides versus the duration of rides.
